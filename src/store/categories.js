Instead, it is still very much a halo device, meant to impress and showcase more than anything else. In fact, it might just be even more unattainable than its predecessors, seeing how it is currently only sold in China, with no official intention of expanding availability and that the still ongoing US sanctions mean no Google Play Services and severely handcapped chipset manufacturing capabilities. And this is all before we even start to consider the Mate X2's eye-watering price tag of around EUR 2300.",
